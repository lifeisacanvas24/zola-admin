# Zola Admin: Simplifying Blog Editing

Zola Logo Markdown Editor

Zola Admin is a powerful tool designed to make editing Zola blog pages accessible to users who may not be comfortable working directly with Markdown in traditional text editors. By leveraging the **TOAST UI Editor**, Zola Admin provides an intuitive interface that supports both WYSIWYG and Markdown modes, making it easy for anyone to create and manage content.

## Why Zola Admin?

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Tailored for those unfamiliar with Markdown syntax, allowing users to focus on content creation without technical barriers.
- **Markdown & WYSIWYG Modes:** Users can switch seamlessly between editing styles, enhancing flexibility and comfort.
- **Enhanced Accessibility:** Designed to empower all users, regardless of their technical expertise.

## Acknowledging SSR Principles

While Zola Admin recognizes that it diverges from the core philosophy of server-side rendering (SSR) without an admin interface, it aims to bridge the gap for non-technical users. This project seeks to enhance content management while still embracing the power of Markdown editing.

## Key Features

- **Rich Text Editing:** Create visually appealing content with ease.
- **Plugins Support:** Extend functionality with various plugins like charts and code syntax highlighting.
- **Customizable Experience:** Tailor the editor according to your needs.

Zola Admin is the perfect solution for anyone looking to simplify their blogging experience while maintaining the benefits of Markdown.
